# Interview test

Your task is to enhance this simple client-server application. There are two issues in this repo that we would like you to create pull requests for. If you only have time for one, start with the upload issue.

We expect to see your code; coding by example is not accepted.
We would love to see some simple form of documentation on the decisions you’ve made. If you considered different solutions, please write why you decided to use the current one.

The application is a simple backend that returns a list of bars, and a client that show these bars in a chart, with the specified names, colors and values. The server part is written in C# .Net Core. Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio Code should run it just fine. There's only one controller, that right now returns static values. The client is an Angular project written in Typescript. The changes needed for these issues are mostly in the backend part, and you only need to do small changes to make it work in the frontend.

### Hints:
- Code quality matters.
- Testing is extremely important to us.
- There are no absolute right and wrong answers to this exercise.
- We’ve tried to provide a clear definition as much as possible but if you are not sure what is expected to be done, do not hesitate to contact us with your questions.
